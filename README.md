# MonoUtils

IMPORTANT:

Has been migrated to [Joyersch.Monogame](https://github.com/Joyersch/Joyersch.Monogame) do to the bad name, bad structure and for consistency with future projects.  
This used to be (and still is) a utility library for [Monogame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) ([Website](https://www.monogame.net/)).  

This library is therefor no longer maintained!  
This library is also not intended for widespread use!
